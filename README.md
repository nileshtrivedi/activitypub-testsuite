# ActivityPub TestSuite

This is a work-in-progress collection of HTTP requests defined as an 
[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) collection. Features like environment 
variables, request chaining (extracting data from responses and using them in subsequent requests) and 
Javascript-based testcases, turn this into an effective testsuite to run 
against any domain or app (eg: Mastodon, Pleroma, GoToSocial, 
WriteFreely, Pixelfed etc).
