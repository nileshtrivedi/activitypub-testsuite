# ActivityPub TestSuite

This is a work-in-progress collection of HTTP requests defined as an 
Insomnia collection. Features like environment variables, request chaining 
(extracting data from responses and using them in subsequent requests) and 
Javascript-based testcases, turn this into an effective testsuite to run 
against any domain.
